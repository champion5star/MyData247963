Hello dear. Hope you are doing well.
I have read your job description carefully and it's very interesting to me.
I have been working on react.js projects for over 9 years and I have rich experience and good knowledge.
I used various react.js themes such as material-ui, antd, mdbreact, react-ionic, chakura-ui, semantic-ui, reactstrap, react-bootstrap... and used redux thunk or saga for state management.
Also I often did unit tests using Jest and Enzyme.
For backend of these react.js frontend projects, I often used Node.js and some severless frameworks, such as firebase, AWS and sometimes I combined it to Laravel.

https://easyprez.fr (react.js + node.js)
http://play.harcomia.com (react.js + laravel + smart contract)
https://re-24.com (react.js + node.js)
...
These are all my past works.
I would be very appreciated if I have a chance to show you how could I help you to meet your goal.
Thank you.

Full stack web developer

Hello! My name is Ben and I am a full stack developer focusing primarily on MERN stack development.

What you get from me?
Someone who will take on your project and guide you through development from start to finish. I position myself on the market in the niche of custom-made projects including e-commerce and blockchain, for which I can cover everything that you need. From brainstorming and creating initial scope, through wireframing and design, to actual development and maintenance.

I communicate everything openly, plan with you, often suggest alternative solutions that are better for various reasons. The end goal is always to make something great, and the only way to do it is to work together and plan ahead!

Also, please do check out my reviews here on the platform and I hope you will get a good idea on how I do what I do.

My work hours overlap basically with the whole world (AM hours with US and PM hours with AUS).

I'm also sharing an office space with a couple of really talented developers/designers so we can always get more hands on deck.

I have worked with a large number of technologies over the years, but here are a few that I find myself gravitating towards lately:

* JavaScript libraries (React.js, Vue.js, Angular.js)
* Javascript Backend Framework(Node.js)
* Frontend Development(HTML, Javascript, CSS, Bootstrap, jQuery)
* Blockchain
* E-Commerce (Magento1 & Magento2)
* PHP Framework(WordPress, Laravel, CodeIgniter)
* Database(MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Firebase)
* Web Design

Let's talk about your project!
