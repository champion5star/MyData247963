I'm a professional Software Developer over 8 years of experience in full stack development and Python script development.
My goal with all my clients is to listen, learn, understand, and execute to the highest level.
I always aim to deliver what the client requires, but if I feel there's a better solution, I'm always willing to give them some input and direction if wanted.
A happy client is a successful project to me

I have a keen eye for detail and a deep understanding of user experience principles, ensuring that my designs not only look great but also provide intuitive navigation and functionality.

My technical expertise, combined with my attention to detail and problem-solving abilities, enable me to deliver high-quality results.
In my previous roles, I have consistently demonstrated my ability to work independently and efficiently.
