TimeJump, The Future of Messaging
Mobile UI DesignSketchInVisionMobile UX Design
TimeJump allows users to send messages in the future and decide when it will reach the recipient.

What I really liked about this project was working on an innovative concept and from scratch.

Workshops with the team and mood boards were really crucial for a project such as this one who needed a specific brand look. Illustrations, colors, and art directory had to represent something fun, positive, and young.

I created a simplified navigation system for users to switch between past and future modes because they are the core of the project. I also wanted to keep the interface straightforward yet playful and attractive.
