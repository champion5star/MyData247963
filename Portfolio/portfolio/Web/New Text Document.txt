Iland is a cloud service provider of secure and compliant hosting for infrastructure, disaster recovery, and backup. They are recognized by industry analysts as a leader in disaster-restoration-and-delivery cloud services throughout North America, Europe, Australia, and Asia.

The most challenging part of the project has been to understand this technical, complicated, and foreign (at least to me) universe and then providing relevant solutions for the navigation. The dashboard had to be easy-to-use and functional, and the UX flows easy-to-understand and coherent. Iconography has played a crucial role to optimize the navigation and make this product less complicated for users.

Besides the UX wireframes, the branding had also been an important point. The constraint was to incorporate the groupâ€™s blue color scheme and create a coherent universe around it.

I design new products, new features, and a fully-responsive site for Iland since 2016.
