Kron Arc is a calendar app that approaches time differently.
The experience is focused on being able to view and compare multiple event lengths from different calendars all at once and gives the user a bird's eye view of how the time is spent on different activities from a macro to micro level.

The challenge behind the design concept was to make the visualization seamless and dynamic through time. Therefore, the orbital concept, where lines on the orbital spaces represent different events.

My role in this project was to create the full product concept, interactions, prototypes, and branding.
