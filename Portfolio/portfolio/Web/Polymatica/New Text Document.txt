SUMMARY
I helped enhance usability and define a visual identity for the new version of Polymatica. I also contributed to adapt this digital product to western European market standards.

PROBLEM STATEMENT
Polymatica is a Russian engineering-driven company that developed a data visualization SaaS solution that targets citizen data scientists. Like a lot of startups, they have rushed to hit the market but did not focus on the user experience and prioritized functionalities.

PROJECT GOAL
The main goal of this project has been to define smoother user experience of the product from an existing MVP and adapt it to the western European market.
We needed also to simplify the product to make it more accessible to a non-data scientists target.
