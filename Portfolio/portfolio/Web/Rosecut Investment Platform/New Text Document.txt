Rosecut is a boutique investment enterprise that focuses on medium and high-profile investors in the UK.
The platform powered by robo-advisors takes the users through an assessment that gives a financial health panorama to help the customer make the best investment decision.

The main challenge in this project was to create a seamless and new consistent experience for the customers taking ready features into consideration and introducing new ones by following the branding guidelines.
The design delivery included design strategy, UX Design, UI Design, and Design Systems.
