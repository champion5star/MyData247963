Blockchain Developer | 30M+ in NFT drops generated | Sandbox Partner
$75.00/hr
✅ Sandbox Partner®
✅ Lil Durk’s (𝟏𝟎𝐌+ 𝐈𝐧𝐬𝐭𝐚𝐠𝐫𝐚𝐦 𝐟𝐨𝐥𝐥𝐨𝐰𝐞𝐫𝐬) NFT Collection Smart Contract Engineer  

Looking to create a new Axie Infinity & disrupt the market?  

Launching an NFT drop and not sure on best strategies to sell out, whitelists, Merkle Trees & smart contract security measures?  

Speaking with a range of so-called blockchain experts claiming they can do everything but can’t answer basic questions & consult you?  

Look no further, you just found your Wild Card.

————————————————————————————
————————————————————————————

I’ve been in the space for a long time, starting with ICOs & PoS coins to zkSync & Metaverse.

  I know what works and what’s not, I know how to make sure you won’t get hacked by poor smart contract development & testing losing months of work & hundreds of thousands of dollars invested with one poor development mistake.  

My paradigm for smart contracts: 30% time development, 70% time testing. Being secure is the most valuable thing on the market.

  Here is what I can do for you:
💠Metaverse development & integration
💠Solidity, Web3, Metamask, Stellar
💠ERC-20, BEP-20 tokens
💠NFT smart contracts, whitelists, Merkle Trees 💠Smart contract audit
💠AMM, DEXs, DeFI projects

————————————————————————————
————————————————————————————


How can you be sure you can trust this guy? Here is one of the reviews of my NFT client who sold out:  

⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ “Ilya and his team are a real asset to the project - we got so much value from his consulting on how to solve the business problem with a blockchain solution, create proper architecture & infrastructure, how to work through security issues, how to integrate web2 & web3 smoothly - Ilya is the partner on the project, not just someone who does a bunch of smart contracts for you with spaghetti code, 0 optimization, tons of bugs, bad communication, low-quality front-end, and leaves."  

————————————————————————————
————————————————————————————  

I have to say my time is very limited right now - meaning that I can only work with a handful of clients at the same time - so the quicker you will respond to me, the better.

  Blockchain consulting is being sold at $1500/hr, if I sent a proposal to your job post that means you can get one for free.
