Describe your dAPP experience in detail.

Let's have a talk and discuss

What frameworks have you worked with?

web3js, Moralis and others

Describe your approach to testing and improving QA

positive

I don’t usually look for new clients, but your post took my attention since I've recently done several successful NFT launches consulting clients on best practices to sell out.

I’m responsible for 2 world's biggest NFT drops this month & next one:
http://adventrobots.com/ (Advent Entertainment, worked with Stan Lee & Larry King involved)
https://www.nxtg3nz.com/ (Lil Durk, Sandbox, Gary Vee involved)

Here is what my recent client who sold out says:
⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ "Ilya and his team are a real asset to the project - we got so much value from his consulting on how to work with whitelists at different stages, what are the most effective marketing channels, how to make sure the drop won't get hacked, how to use discord bots properly - Ilya is the partner on the project, not just someone who does smart contract for you with spaghetti code, 0 optimization, tons of bugs, bad communication and leaves. "

Surely you want to work with somebody with deep NFT knowledge, someone who can not only engineer but consult you on the industry trends & best practices. If that’s the case, I can help you.

Maybe this will be a perfect fit for us. I expect people to give business their all, and I return the favor. If you’re truly passionate about this, let’s hop on a call.

There, I showcase my previous experience with regard to NFTs.

I also provide case studies of some of my previous clients.

And lastly, I describe exactly the reasons why you should go with me, over someone else.

Smart contract is 10% of the NFT drop work that can endanger the 90% - get a partner, not a developer.

NFT drop consultations from qualified & experienced NFT engineers are being sold at $1500/hr - today is an opportunity to get one for free.

Reply to this message to set up a time to chat.

Kind regards,
Ilya
